## 🌱 Inspiration

As students, we know college life can be overwhelming. Between classes, deadlines, and daily stressors, mental health often takes a backseat.

**Mind Glance** is our attempt to change that.

We realized:
- ✅ **Journaling** builds self-awareness
- ✅ **To-do lists** give a sense of accomplishment
- ✅ **Cognitive games** boost alertness and joy
- ✅ **Personalization** makes it feel yours

So we brought all of this into one mobile app — backed by sentiment analysis and designed for daily use.
